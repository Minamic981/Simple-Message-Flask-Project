# Simple Message Flask Project
Hello everyone, this Flask project is very simple for when you want to send me a message from two PCs or have it on your personal server and you can easily transfer the texts you want from a `WSGYWI editor` so that you can edit any text that you want. Send me what you liked
The data is saved in a `data.txt` file
This project is very simple and I would be very happy if you have an idea to improve this project
Regarding security, I made it very simple and my suggestion is in the local network
